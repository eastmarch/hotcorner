## Volumouse

Control system settings using the cursor + mousewheel:
 * Top-left corner: turn the volume up and down
 * Top-right corner: switch between virtual desktops

Mouse middle click:
 * Top-left corner: open task viewer

### Hotkeys
 * `ALT+SHIFT+F12`: quit program
 * `CTRL+ALT+F12`: force update corner coordinates

### Details
This program only works on the main monitor. Any corner besides top-left needs to be calculated in relation to the screen resolution. To address that without adding more event listeners for resolution and DPI changes. The "force update" hotkey was made available.
